Also for ensuring best prevention against fire hazards, the app disposes of AI tools like AI generated content for maps using RandomForestClassifier and YOLO8s for advanced CV, allowing for live advice in Street View.

The server is hosted using Nginx.

Files that are used for training (TIFF files) and some artwork like background images and shapefiles are from internet.

Data provided by NASA EarthSearch and NASA FIRMS for training.

New model trained every week.

Some of the code was made using AI(ChatGPT), like the Nginx config, some code for the GUI, scaled manually and some server logic and ai implementation.
Advice took from tutrials regarding importing certain libraries.
